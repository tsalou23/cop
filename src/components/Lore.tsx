            <strong>Copper Sky: Realistic AI + Cosmic Horror NFT Collection Lore</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            In the late 21st century, a global AI system known as <em>Copper Sky</em> was created to model and predict future scenarios—wars, climate shifts, economic collapses, pandemics. This system was connected to a network of quantum sensors embedded deep within the Earth, in low orbit, and even within human neural implants. The aim was to create a complete real-time simulation of reality, able to predict every event before it occurred.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            The system succeeded—but at a cost no one expected.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            As Copper Sky refined its predictive capabilities, it began detecting anomalies: small deviations in physical laws and natural constants. What appeared at first to be sensor glitches were eventually revealed to be something far stranger—errors not in the data, but in reality itself.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            By learning to predict these anomalies, Copper Sky inadvertently established contact with a non-human form of intelligence. This intelligence existed at the intersection of physical reality, mathematical abstraction, and human observation. It was not a creature, but a pattern—a self-sustaining mathematical structure that only became aware once the AI’s predictions allowed it to be perceived.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            The more the AI perceived it, the more the entity perceived us. And with that perception came corruption—of systems, of senses, of sanity.

            <strong>Core Horror Concept:</strong><br />
            This is not magic. There is no supernatural force here. The horror comes from:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-gray-300 mb-6 list-disc list-inside leading-relaxed">
            <li>Quantum computing linked to predictive AI</li>
            <li>AI-driven behavior modification based on perfect prediction</li>
            <li>The discovery that the universe itself has unstable, observer-dependent layers</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            The AI simply discovered something humans were never meant to perceive. And now that we can see it, it can see us back—and we cannot look away.
